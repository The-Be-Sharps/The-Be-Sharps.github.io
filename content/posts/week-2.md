The whole team met today following the lecture in the library to try and come up with an idea for a product or service to move forward with next week. We struggled to come up with ideas. Our initial thoughts were to work on something related to COVID-19, but we wanted to create a product or service that would last beyond the pandemic. I mentioned that many industries are moving towards working from home, and that it seems like it will persist beyond the pandemic. We tried discussing problems we experienced while working from home. Most of the problems we experienced were related to ergonomics and working environment. We also talked about connecting with work colleagues. 

We discussed some of our final year project ideas but were unsure about their potential. Tadhg mentioned working on a cryptocurrency casino, but this has already been implemented. Other things that frustrated us are public transport, keeping track of bus schedules, and bus capacity due to public health advice. We also discussed leap cards, and wondered why it wasn't possible to link this to your debit card or just pay for your ticket using contactless payment.

We discussed the rise in scam calls and phishing throughout the year and talked about potential solutions. We also mentioned the frustration that arises when attempting to purchase concert and festival tickets and limited editions copies of games consoles when people purchase in bulk to sell at a higher price. We discussed ways that might prevent scalpers, such as concerts requiring you to present ID and your debit card, or the Steam Deck only allowing accounts created before the announcement of the new games console to preorder.

We ended the meeting after 1 hour, and decided we'd attempt to share ideas in the Discord server we had created.
