## Total Addressable Market Calculations
Assume the price in the Play Store and the App Store of the application was $1:
- Online Gamblers (EU) would earn $16,000,000
- Gamers who spend on Microtransactions would earn $2.8188 Billion
- Parents who wish to monitor and restrict child spending would earn $2.3615 Billion

This would be a total of $5.1963 Billion in revenue.
